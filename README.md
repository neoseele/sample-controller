# sample-controller

This repository implements a simple controller for watching Foo resources as
defined with a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD).

This particular example demonstrates how to perform basic operations such as:

* How to register a new custom resource (custom resource type) of type `Foo` using a CustomResourceDefinition.
* How to create/get/list instances of your new resource type `Foo`.
* How to setup a controller on resource handling create/update/delete events.

It makes use of the generators in [k8s.io/code-generator](https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator)
to generate a typed client, informers, listers and deep-copy functions. You can
do this yourself using the `./hack/update-codegen.sh` script.

The `update-codegen` script generate the following files & directories:

* `pkg/apis/samplecontroller/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go`
* `pkg/generated/`

Changes should not be made to these files manually, and when creating your own
controller based off of this implementation you should not copy these files and
instead run the `update-codegen` script to generate your own.

## Details

The sample controller uses [client-go library](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/tools/cache) extensively.
The details of interaction points of the sample controller with various mechanisms from this library are
explained [here](docs/controller-client-go.md).

## Fetch sample-controller and its dependencies

Like the rest of Kubernetes, sample-controller has used
[godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) and `$GOPATH` for years and is
now adopting go 1.11 modules.  There are thus two alternative ways to
go about fetching this demo and its dependencies.

### Fetch with godep

When NOT using go 1.11 modules, you can use the following commands.

```sh
go get -d k8s.io/sample-controller
cd $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/sample-controller
godep restore
```

### When using go 1.11 modules

When using go 1.11 modules (`GO111MODULE=on`), issue the following
commands --- starting in whatever working directory you like.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller.git
cd sample-controller
```

Note, however, that if you intend to
[generate code](#changes-to-the-types) then you will also need the
code-generator repo to exist in an old-style location.  One easy way
to do this is to use the command `go mod vendor` to create and
populate the `vendor` directory.

### A Note on kubernetes/kubernetes

If you are developing Kubernetes according to
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md
then you already have a copy of this demo in
`kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/sample-controller` and its dependencies
--- including the code generator --- are in usable locations
(valid for all Go versions).

## Purpose

- clone the Repo

> The script requires the code to be cloned into the `~/k8s.io` directory

```sh
# assumes you have a working kubeconfig, not required if operating in-cluster
go build -o sample-controller .
./sample-controller -kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/config

# create a CustomResourceDefinition
kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/crd.yaml

# create a custom resource of type Foo
kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/example-foo.yaml

# check deployments created through the custom resource
kubectl get deployments
```

## Use Cases

CustomResourceDefinitions can be used to implement custom resource types for your Kubernetes cluster.
These act like most other Resources in Kubernetes, and may be `kubectl apply`'d, etc.

Some example use cases:

* Provisioning/Management of external datastores/databases (eg. CloudSQL/RDS instances)
* Higher level abstractions around Kubernetes primitives (eg. a single Resource to define an etcd cluster, backed by a Service and a ReplicationController)

## Defining types

Each instance of your custom resource has an attached Spec, which should be defined via a `struct{}` to provide data format validation.
In practice, this Spec is arbitrary key-value data that specifies the configuration/behavior of your Resource.

For example, if you were implementing a custom resource for a Database, you might provide a DatabaseSpec like the following:

git clone git@github.com:neoseele/sample-controller.git

cd ~/k8s.io/sample-controller
```


- create and populate vendor dir

```sh
go mod vendor
chmod +x ./vendor/k8s.io/code-generator/generate-groups.sh
```

### Example

The CRD in [`crd-status-subresource.yaml`](./artifacts/examples/crd-status-subresource.yaml) enables the `/status` subresource
for custom resources.
This means that [`UpdateStatus`](./controller.go#L330) can be used by the controller to update only the status part of the custom resource.

To understand why only the status part of the custom resource should be updated, please refer to the [Kubernetes API conventions](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status).

In the above steps, use `crd-status-subresource.yaml` to create the CRD:

```sh
./hack/update-codegen.sh
Generating deepcopy funcs
Generating clientset for samplecontroller:v1alpha1 at k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/clientset
Generating listers for samplecontroller:v1alpha1 at k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/listers
Generating informers for samplecontroller:v1alpha1 at k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/informers
```
